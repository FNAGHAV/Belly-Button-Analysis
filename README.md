# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Background
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), are present in over 70% of people, while the majority are relatively rare.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interactive and informative visualization of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard includes a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a panel displaying metadata for each sample. The application allows users to select different samples from a dropdown menu, dynamically updating the visualizations and metadata display.

Features
Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual's sample.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes all OTUs in the selected individual's sample.
Metadata Panel: Displays demographic information for the selected individual.
Dynamic Updates: All visualizations and metadata update when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.
Deployment: The app is deployed using GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.

How to Use
Selection: Choose a sample from the dropdown menu to update the charts and metadata.
Interactivity: Hover over the bars and bubbles to see detailed information about each OTU.
